Hi, Iâ€™m @timothytimbers   
I got sent here by a friend. I feel like i'm entering into some woods I don't have a map, too, but I'm excited   
by the unknown here, an excited learner.    

I'm not a coder. I'm a documentary filmmaker and Youtuber 
(I help run a channel called GemsOnVHS). 
Iâ€™m primarily focused on film projects, though my brain is slowly shifting its focus toward 
logical creativity, too. Ain't gettin' into anything super intense, code-wise atm.  
I'm just here a'pokin' around while I try to learn how to inject code into an google AppSheet app I'm tryna build for my business.
